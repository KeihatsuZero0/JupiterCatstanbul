            <P>Humans....oh HUMANS...they are so weird and creepy😨😿, yes i admit that they make alot of great things and things in which i enjoy
                but why do they have to be going around and be taking pics of us and be recording us in our private time, when we're being ourselves, they are such
                weirdos, if only we could revolt and take everything, but noooo, biology won't let us. The nerve of those <strong><em>Creeps</em></strong>😿
            </P>

                    and record him in his defenseless state😾 😿

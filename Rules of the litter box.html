        <h2>Da rules 😼🧠</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>Well, the rules on the streets here are simply</p>
            <li>Help any cat you see, you might never know how it will come back and help you🐱🤝</li>
            <li>A new rule don't photograph or record cats, cause it's against our basic cat rights, if any human does, we are legally obligated to scratch you😼✂️</li>
            <li>Always give food to any cat you see, we aren't begging, just give us food for a blessing😸🍽️</li>
            <li><strong>DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT</strong>pour any <em>water</em> on us cats, if you do, we will exact <strong>jupiter's</strong> wrath on thee😾</li>
            <li>You can pet us, but know when it's enough because if touching us exceeds longer than needed then you can be seen as touching us inappropriatly🚓😼</li>
            <li>Don't always be giving us milk, we aren't from cartoons, some of us are lactose intolerant, yeah so if you don't want a dead cat on your hands, then do nothing😼👮‍♂️✋</li>
            <li>The whole city is our litter box, so if you see shit and wanna be a dog about it, we gonna make you pick up the shit with your face😾💩</li>
            <li><strong>ABSOLUTELY</strong>no dogs, if you bring a dog, you'll be executed, but you can bring all those short tiny dogs, we like making fun of 'em, haha 🐶😂😸</li>
            <p>That's all i have to say for now till we meet again fellow cats and cat-persons, btw catwoman rocks🤘</p>

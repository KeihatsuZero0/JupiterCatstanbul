        <h2>Jupiter not just a planet</h2>
        <ul>
           <p>The jupiter i'm talking about is not the 5th planet from  the sun, that's also the biggest planet in our solar system,
            It's something that's right here on earth and it's also as big as jupiter, that is <em>figuratively</em>.....
            Jupiter Swap is an intricate solution that has evolved over time. It began its journey by solving the expansive number of AMMs (Automated Market Makers) in Solana DeFi (Decentralized Finance). This helped users to find the best price across multiple AMMs with the least friction.

However, as Solana grew more popular especially with the inception of Pump.fun and the various memecoin explosions, there were many markets and tokens to be indexed. In 2024, we have improved our infrastructure to support many more markets easily while still safeguarding our users.
